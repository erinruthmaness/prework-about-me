      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>After majoring in French and working in publishing and then insurance for my twenties, I'm excited to learn software development and start a new career path.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Burlington, NC. After college I lived in Paris for two years and Manhattan for two years before deciding to make Charlotte my home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hosting movie and game nights with my friends, wandering the greenway, writing, and telling my cat he's a baby.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to go to work every day knowing that I am doing something worthy and able to live comfortably with no debt because of it.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in an outdated but well-loved condo in South Charlotte near Pineville and Ballantyne.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always enjoyed taking things apart to learn how they work, spending time online, and problem-solving. I believe web development will align with these interests while providing exciting job opportunities in my area.</p>
